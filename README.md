🍽️ Multi-Threaded Customer–Table Synchronization System
Using POSIX Threads, Mutex Locks & Semaphores

This project simulates a dining-hall environment where multiple customer threads compete for a limited number of tables. It demonstrates real-world concurrency challenges such as synchronization, queueing, fairness, and resource sharing.

⭐ Features

Dynamic customer-thread creation using random batch sizes

Random delay between thread batches to simulate real arrivals

Mutex + semaphore-based synchronization

Controlled table allocation (limited resources)

Analysis of waiting-time trends under different parameters

Fully multi-threaded design using pthreads

Output logs for debugging and performance analysis

📌 System Modeling Overview

Customers arrive in randomly sized groups.

A random delay is inserted before creating the next group.

Every customer thread tries to get a table:

It checks if tables are available.

If the dining hall is full or other customers are waiting:

The thread waits using sem_wait(&x_sem).

Otherwise:

The thread enters, eats, and leaves.

After eating:

If the table becomes empty:

Waiting threads are signaled (either up to the number of tables or all).

A global array tracks individual thread waiting times:

Thread-safe because each thread accesses only its own index.

📊 Analysis of Graph 1
Effect of Number of Customers on Average Waiting Time

General Trend:
More customers → Higher waiting time

Case 1: More customers ⇒ more wait

Case 2: More delay between customer batches ⇒ less wait

Observations:

From 15 to 25 customers: waiting time increases (Case 1 dominates)

From 25 to 30 customers: waiting time decreases

Because customers at 25 may have been created much earlier and waited longer

📉 Analysis of Graph 2
Effect of Number of Tables on Waiting Time

General Trend:
More tables → Less waiting time

Case 1: More tables ⇒ customers wait less

Case 2: Larger delay ⇒ customers wait less

Observations:

From 4 → 5 tables: waiting time increases

Delays at 5 may cause customers to arrive earlier → more waiting

From 5 → 6 tables: sharp drop

Good benefit from both Case 1 and Case 2

From 6 → 8 tables: slow decrease

Delay differences become negligible
